# Markov-Chain-Page-Rank

Written by Adam Claxton, Connor Jackson

This project is an implementation of Google's PageRank algorithm, see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank

It uses theory from topics such as Markov Chains and Steady State Vectors in its implementation.

In order to simulate the algorithm, we use data gathered from https://www.hollins.edu and its many webpages, observing what pages link to each other.
