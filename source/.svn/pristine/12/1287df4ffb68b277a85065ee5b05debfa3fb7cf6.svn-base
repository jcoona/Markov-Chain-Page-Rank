Tip for making a website rank higher in search engines:

One of the things search engines look for when ranking websites is how many other websites link to it. So if you can, host content that people are likely to share with others. Original images that don't exist elsewhere on the internet are a good thing to have - a unique image allows your website to compete against others that DON’T have that image.
